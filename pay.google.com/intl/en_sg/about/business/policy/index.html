        <h2 id="prohibited-products-and-services"><a name="prohibited-products-services"></a>Prohibited products and services</h2>
        <p>To become a Google Pay for Business business partner or use Google Pay as a merchant or biller, you must comply with our policies on prohibited products and services. These restrictions would apply regardless of whether the prohibited products or services form your entire inventory or only a part of it. Businesses who trade in any products or services prohibited by applicable laws are not allowed to use Google Pay as billers or merchants, or become Google Pay for Business business partners. A non-exhaustive list of prohibited products and services includes the following:</p>
        <h4 id="adult-products-and-services">Adult products and services</h4>
        <p>We do not allow Google Pay to be used for pornography and other sexually explicit material. This includes but is not limited to: prostitution, escort or companionship services, or any product or service which promotes underage, non-consensual, or other illegal sexual themes.</p>
        <h4 id="counterfeit,-illegal,-or-stolen-products-and-services">Counterfeit, illegal, or stolen products and services</h4>
        <p>Google Pay (and hence Google Pay for Business) may not be used for transactions of illegal products or services; products produced in violation of a third party's rights; replicas or imitations of designer or other products; or counterfeit goods.</p>

        <h4 id="dangerous">Dangerous</h4>
        <p>We want to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don&rsquo;t allow Google Pay to be used for transactions on products that may cause damage, harm, or injury (e.g. guns and other weapons, explosives, drugs).</p>
        <h4 id="enabling-dishonest-behavior">Enabling dishonest behavior</h4>

        <p>Offers, communications, and any related content are intended for quality exchanges between businesses and users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Do not aggressively send communications to users on Google Pay.</p>
          </li>

          </li>

        <h4 id="requesting-user-information">Requesting User Information</h4>
        <p>Businesses should have a clear privacy policy and should obtain users&rsquo; express and informed consent prior to the collection of any user information in connection with any offer or communication.</p>
        <h3 id="offer-conditions"><a name="offer-conditions"></a>Offer conditions</h3>
        <p>Businesses are responsible for honoring all offers made via Google Pay for Business. To maintain a high quality user experience on Google Pay for Business, all offers must meet the following conditions:</p>
        <h4 id="offers-must-not-misrepresent-the-business,-product-or-service">Offers must not misrepresent the business, product or service</h4>
        <p>Users should not feel misled by the content of the offers made via Google Pay for Business, and that means being upfront, honest, and providing them with the information that they need to make informed decisions. Offers must not represent you or your products in a way that is not accurate, realistic, and truthful. For example, they must not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Be misleading (e.g. making false statements about the business or qualifications, falsely affiliate with other individuals, organizations, products and services, or false claims which position improbable results as likely outcomes even if they are technically possible)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Be unavailable or otherwise difficult to purchase (e.g. have no available stock, be inactive, promote prices which are inaccurate, or be difficult to find on the business landing page)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Contain superlative or comparative claims without third-party verification (e.g. &ldquo;best&rdquo;, &ldquo;#1&rdquo;, &ldquo;better than&rdquo;)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Contain information which is not clearly relevant to the actual product or service on the destination page</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Conceal or misstate information about the business, product, or service (e.g. using a false identity, business name or contact information, offers for products or services that are normally offered for free)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fail to disclose the payment model and full expense that a user will bear (e.g. shipping costs and other billing related information; recurring subscription costs)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Prompt users to initiate a purchase, download, or other commitment without first providing all relevant information and obtaining the user&rsquo;s explicit consent</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="use-of-trademarks">Use of trademarks</h4>
        <p>Businesses are allowed to use trademarks in the title or description of an offer when it is for a trademarked product or product compatible with the trademarked product. It is the business&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that any such use complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including laws on comparative advertising.</p>
        <h4 id="offers-must-add-value-above-and-beyond-the-listed-price">Offers must add value above and beyond the listed price</h4>
        <p>Promotions should provide a monetary discount or an additional good or service not normally associated with the purchase.</p>
        <p>Product prices stated on an offer and product prices officially listed by the business must be exactly the same or rounded to the nearest whole currency unit (eg: ₨ 39.95 on the website may be rounded to ₨ 40.00 on the Offer). Prices under one whole currency unit must be exact.</p>
        <p>We also do not allow promotions that are sweepstakes or which include text only meant to advertise the product without a discount.</p>
        <h3 id="offer-redemption">Offer redemption</h3>
        <p>Businesses are expected to conform to the following guidelines on offer redemption:</p>
        <h4 id="offers-must-be-honored">Offers must be honored</h4>
        <p>Businesses are expected to honor all offers made via Google Pay for Business. Any disputes that arise between businesses and users are the sole responsibility of the business. Offer redemption rules that are different from a business&rsquo; usual non-offer business operations should be clear, transparent and accurate. Businesses are encouraged to provide detailed information on rescheduling or cancellation and to ensure any restrictions on these are clearly outlined in the offer terms.</p>
        <h4 id="offers-must-have-an-online-and/or-offline-place-of-redemption">Offers must have an online and/or offline place of redemption</h4>
        <p>Offers should clearly outline how and where the user can redeem their offer. It should also be redeemable at all locations identified.</p>
        <h4 id="offers-must-not-have-hidden-or-undisclosed-additional-costs">Offers must not have hidden or undisclosed additional costs</h4>
        <p>Offer terms must clearly disclose any billing expectations, additional charges, minimum purchase limits, etc. as a result of redeeming a promotion with the business. Hidden fees disclosed upon redemption are not permissible.</p>
        <p>Businesses must not impose deal-specific costs on users upon redemption if these costs do not apply to non-deal purchases. In other words, when users redeem their offer, they should not be subject to fees which do not apply to users not redeeming an offer.</p>
        <h4 id="offers-must-not-have-unspecified-additional-requirements">Offers must not have unspecified additional requirements</h4>
        <p>Offers must be redeemable without unspecified additional user requirements. We do not allow offers which businesses impose requirements not included in their terms and conditions in order to redeem. Any additional requirements must not impose undue costs or effort on users. Unacceptable additional requirements include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Signing up for a store credit card</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Creating a store account</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Accessing additional store content</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="inventory-limitations">Inventory limitations</h4>
        <p>Any limitations to the user&rsquo;s access to non-offer inventory (e.g. applicable blackout dates, offer-specific rescheduling rules, or products/services not covered by the offer) must be made clear to the user up front.</p>
        <h3 id="editorial-guidelines"><a name="editorial-guidelines"></a>Editorial guidelines</h3>
        <p>All text and image content in Google Pay for Business Offers and related communications must conform to the following standards to ensure they are clear and do not contain inappropriate content.</p>
        <h4 id="editorial-&amp;-professional-standards">Editorial &amp; professional standards</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><em>Grammar, spelling and spacing</em>: All business content must use commonly accepted spelling, basic grammar and be written in logical sentence form. This includes correct spacing between words and around punctuation and no typos.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Punctuation and Symbols</em>: Offers must not contain an excessive use of numbers, letters or symbols.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Inappropriate language</em>: Offers and related communications must not contain inappropriate or offensive language or images.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Capitalization</em>: Offers must not contain excessive or incorrect capitalization. Only proper names should be capitalized, not every word.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Gimmicky text</em>: Offers must avoid repetition of words, phrases and punctuation, and should not include any unnecessary or irrelevant text.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Image quality</em>: Images should be clear and recognizable, and not blurry. They should not appear sideways or upside down.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Language</em>: Offers must be in English.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="title-guidelines">Title guidelines</h4>
        <p>Offer titles should provide a complete description of the offer that is easy to understand and accurately summarizes the deal being promoted by including the value of the offer or discount on products. It should not be generic promotional text, or attempt to trick or mislead users by stating a deal which does not match the detailed description or terms and conditions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>State the value of the promotion (% off, ₹ off, Free item, etc.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>State the items or types of purchases valid for discount (i.e. &ldquo;jewelry&rdquo; or &ldquo;all footwear and accessories&rdquo;)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Including any unrelated information is cause for rejection; avoid any nonessential words and details that do not clarify the promotion</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do not use exclamation marks</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do not use all capital letters or capitalize the first letter of every word</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>60 characters maximum</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>₹100 off purchase of ₹500 or more</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>50% off select women&rsquo;s clothing</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Free eyeshadow with ₹250 purchase</p>
          </li>

            <p>Men&rsquo;s shirts: Buy one, get one 50% off</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="urls">URLs</h4>
        <p>Any URLs contained within Google Pay for Business Offers or related content must not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Contain links to malicious or unwanted software (as defined&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/about/unwanted-software-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Contain visible URL text that contains obscenity, profanity, or offensive slurs</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Attempt to circumvent Google Pay&rsquo;s systems and processes which are used for enforcement purposes e.g. through the use of dynamic DNS to switch page or ad content, or manipulate offer text</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Google Pay for Business-created labels, URLs, and their destinations must also conform to these Google Pay for Business Policies and not contain any prohibited goods or services or inappropriate content as described in our policies.</p>
