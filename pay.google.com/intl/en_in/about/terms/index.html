Through Google Pay, you may send payments to service providers, Users, Merchants, Billers or third parties using any Payment Instruments accepted through Google Pay.

In addition, Google Pay allows you to communicate with or receive communications, offers and services from other Users, service providers, Banks, Merchants and Billers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to UPI Payment Transactions, Google Pay is a TPAP authorised by NPCI&nbsp;to facilitate Payment Transactions through HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India.

We are bound by tripartite agreements entered with NPCI and each of our the sponsor PSP&rsquo;s - HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and State Bank of India. For the exact roles and responsibilities of Google Pay, PSP and NPCI in a UPI Payment Transaction, please refer <a href="../external/npci/index.html">here</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to UPI Transactions, you are subject to that PSP's terms and conditions.</span></p>
        <p>Google Pay may facilitate provision of third party products or services to you within Google Pay. These third party products or services are offered by parties other than Google, and are subject to third party terms. You may need to accept additional terms and conditions and meet additional requirements to use these third party services. You should only transact with a third party product or service that you trust. Google will not be responsible or liable to you for any loss incurred by you as a result of your interaction with a third party product or service on Google Pay.</p>
        <p><strong>Mechanics of Payment Transaction</strong>. The Payment Transactions or any communication/offers carried out through Google Pay are solely between the Sender and Recipient of the payment. Google Pay creates a link between the Sender, the Recipient and the respective Payments System Providers to facilitate sending and/or receiving payments using Payments System Provider Services. Once a Payment Transaction has been authenticated, authorised and processed through the Payments System Provider Services:</p>
        <p>(i) the payment may be settled directly with the Recipient by the respective Payments Participants; or</p>
        <p>(ii) in certain scenarios, we may act as an intermediary and receive funds pertaining to the Payment Transaction on behalf of the Recipient. In such scenarios, Google would operate purely as the Recipient&rsquo;s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting funds from Users.</p>
        <p><strong>Google&rsquo;s Role in Payment Transactions</strong>. You understand and agree to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google is only a facilitator of Payment Transactions.</li>
          <li>Google is not a party to these Payment Transactions.</li>
          <li>Google is not a Payments System Provider.</li>
          <li>Google may, in certain scenarios, act as an intermediary and operate as a payment collection agent for the limited purpose of receiving funds on behalf of the Recipient.</li>
          <li>Google is not and will not be responsible for any aspect of the products or services you purchase.</li>
          <li>Google is not and will not be responsible for any communications made by you or any communication or offers made to you through Google Pay.</li>
          <li>Google is not a party to and will not be responsible for any disputes, chargebacks or reversals arising pursuant to Payment Transactions.</li>
          <li>Google is not responsible for any act of Users, including, non-completion of a Transaction.</li>
          <li>The facilitation of a Transaction does not guarantee that the Sender has sufficient funds available in the Funding Account he or she used, that the Transaction will be authorized or processed, or that the Transaction will not later result in a chargeback or other reversal.</li>
          <li>Google is neither acting as a trustee nor acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to any Payment Transaction.</li>
          <li>Google does not determine, advise or in any manner control the commercial terms of the Payment Transaction, including the price of products and services offered for sale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disclaimer of Google&rsquo;s Liability</strong>. Google is not responsible for any aspect of the products or services you purchase or for any communications or offers made to you. Google&rsquo;s role as a payment collection agent for the Recipient will not make Google liable or responsible for breach of representations and warranties, non-provision of after-sales or warranty services or fraud vis-a-vis the products and/or services sold by a Merchant.</p>
        <p><strong>Bill Payment Services</strong>.

If you do not agree to such automatically requested and received Updates, then please do not use the Google Pay App. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Google may update the Google Pay App to a new version of such app, irrespective of any update settings that you may have selected within the Google Pay App or your device, if Google determines that the update will fix a critical security vulnerability related to the Google Pay App.</p>
        <h3>5. Setting Up Google Pay Services</h3>
        <p>You must have a Google Account to use Google Pay. If you do not already have a Google Account, you can register for one on Google Pay. When you login to your Google Account on Google Pay, your Google Pay Services will be activated, subject to you accepting these Combined Google Pay Terms. If you disable your Google account, all related accounts, including your Google Pay account will be suspended. You can seek restoration of the Google Account, which will also restore your access to your Google Pay Account. It is possible that as a result of disabling the Google Account by you, some account specific data may be lost or purged and may not be retrievable. You agree and accept that Google is not responsible for the loss of data or any other damage suffered by you as a result of the closure of the Google account by you and its subsequent restoration.</p>
        <p>During the login/registration process or anytime thereafter, you may be asked to provide information such as your name, phone number, Payment Instrument information (including, but not limited to, your bank name and bank account number, credit card/debit card details, if applicable), date of birth, and/or other registration information. We may verify your registration information with a Payment Participant, service provider, and/or Third Party Provider, as defined below. In some cases, we may ask you to send us additional information/documentation or to answer additional questions (before or after your Google Account on Google Pay has been activated) to help us verify your identity or the accuracy of the information you provided. The provision and use of such data is subject to the Google Privacy Policy, as described more fully in Section 18 below. We may deny your use of the Google Pay Services, if we are unable to verify that the accuracy or completeness of the information and documentation you provided or we determine that you are not eligible to use Google Pay, pursuant to the Combined Google Pay Terms or the Payment Participant Rules.</p>
        <p><strong>Setting up BHIM UPI Services</strong>. If you desire to use BHIM UPI to send or receive payments, you may use Google Pay to register with a BHIM UPI Payments System Provider partnered with Google and create your BHIM UPI user credentials, such as your BHIM UPI ID (virtual payment address) and/or BHIM UPI PIN (MPIN) linked. Once you have registered for BHIM UPI services, you can send payments from your bank account or receive payments into your bank account using BHIM UPI through Google Pay.</p>
        <p><strong>Setting up a Virtual Account Number</strong>. You may also use Google Pay to make Payment Transactions using a bank-issued virtual account number representing a credit or debit card you register with Google Pay, transit passes,&nbsp;and digital wallets or accounts that you have with companies other than Google&nbsp;(each&nbsp;a "<strong>Virtual Account Number</strong>"). Virtual Account Numbers may be used: (i) at participating merchant locations, using a QR code through your Google Pay App that resides on your mobile device, or (ii) online through certain merchant apps, <span style="font-weight: 400;">or (iii) on your Google Pay app for processing bill payments or other merchant Payment Transactions. Google Pay does not store the actual number of the underlying debit card or credit card and only saves the Virtual Account Number</span>.</p>
        <p>After you have begun to add a Virtual Account Number to Google Pay, Google Pay will check whether the payment method is eligible. If your payment method&rsquo;s issuer supports Google Pay and your payment method is eligible, when adding it you may see a screen asking you to accept the issuer&rsquo;s terms and conditions. Once you have done so and successfully added the payment method, Google Pay will store a Virtual Account Number representing your payment method&rsquo;s actual card number or other identifier with your Google Account for use with Google Pay.</p>
        <p>Except where Google or its affiliate is the issuer, neither Google nor its affiliates are a party to your payment methods&rsquo; user agreement, privacy policy, or other terms of use. Nothing in these Combined Google Pay Terms modifies any such issuer terms. In the event of any inconsistency between these Combined Google Pay Terms and your issuer&rsquo;s terms or privacy policy, these Combined Google Pay Terms will govern the relationship between you and Google with respect to Google Pay, and your issuer&rsquo;s terms will govern the relationship between you and the issuer. Google does not make any representation or verify that any of your payment methods is in good standing or that the issuer of your payment method will authorize or approve any transaction with a merchant or transit provider when you use Google Pay for that transaction.</p>
        <p>Except where Google or its affiliate is the issuer, neither Google nor its affiliates are involved in issuing credit or determining eligibility for credit, nor do they exercise control over: the availability or accuracy of payment methods or funds; the provisioning (or addition) of payment methods to Google Pay, or addition of funds to payment method balances. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Issuer provides services to register or deregister your Virtual Account Number for specific uses and to set and modify Payment Transaction limits. </span>For any concerns relating to the foregoing, please contact your payment method&rsquo;s issuer.</p>
