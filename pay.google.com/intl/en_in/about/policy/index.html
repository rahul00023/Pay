        <h1>GOOGLE PAYMENTS USER POLICIES</h1>
        <h3 id="about-our-policies">ABOUT OUR POLICIES</h3>
        <p>Google has developed the following policies to promote a trustworthy and secure environment on Google Pay and Google payments (collectively, &ldquo;the service&rdquo;). Any individual or business using Google Pay, or processing transactions with Google payments, must adhere to these policies.</p>
        <p>If you suspect any abusive or illegal content or activities on Google Pay or Google payments, please&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/pay/india/contact/report_activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>&nbsp;it to us immediately. Please note that most transaction-related issues - such as requests for chargebacks or refunds - may best be resolved by talking early and directly between the parties involved in the transaction (e.g. your bank, card issuer, or any other party you are transacting with). We will not be in a position to arbitrate disputes.</p>
        <p>Google reserves the right to change these policies at any time. This Policy has to be read together with the terms of service of the particular product you are using, which may contain additional rules on how to use the service.</p>
        <h3 id="user-policies">USER POLICIES</h3>
        <h4 id="profile-and-registration">Profile and registration</h4>
        <p>Be sure to use your first and last name on your profile when using Google Pay or any other Google payments service. This will help build a trustworthy environment, and help connect you with people you know. You must provide accurate details regarding your identity and payment options, to enable smooth and continuous provision of service.</p>
        <h4 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h4>
        <p>Do not use the service to mislead or confuse other users by pretending to be someone else or representing an organization without authorization to do so. In addition, your account profile name and photo cannot include content that is adult-oriented, offensive, or illegal.</p>
        <h4 id="personal-and-confidential-information">Personal and Confidential Information</h4>
        <p>Do not use, share or distribute others&rsquo; personal and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, confidential national ID numbers, or account passwords, without their permission. If you suspect that your account has been hijacked, please&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/pay/india/#contact=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a>. Do not attempt to use others&rsquo; accounts without their permission, or steal their personal and confidential information.</p>
        <h4 id="spam">Spam</h4>
